# CPSC 583 Group Project: Interactive Data Visualization

Assignment: Using the data collected in phase 3 of the UCalgary Fall 2023 CPSC 583 group project, create a unique data vizualization with at least two interaction techniques. 

This implementation uses Swift to create a little app for MacOS. The visualization is not designed to easily generalize to any data, but to present the current data in an interactive way. 

## Usage

Runnable on MacOS >= 13/Ventura, Xcode >= 15. Relies on SwiftData framework newly available in that Xcode release (currently Beta). Uses SwiftUI views to define layout and support interaction techniques. 

## Navigating the Project

Source code can be found in `cpsc583visualizationApp.swift` and in the `Views` and `Data` folders. Source data was cleaned using Tableau Prep since the Phase 3 submission and can also be found in the `Data` folder.
